##### An API showing several quotes said by famous Formula 1 drivers and Formula 1 personalities. It scraps all the quotes from certain webs

##### Very easy to use. GET ```/``` shows all the F1 drivers or personalities who have quotes saved in this API, and their code to access them. For example: Max Verstappen's quotes: ```/quotes/verstappen```. Please, realize that there are people with the same last name, so you will have to write the name-last name. Example: `/quotes/michael-schumacher` and `/quotes/mick-schumacher`
